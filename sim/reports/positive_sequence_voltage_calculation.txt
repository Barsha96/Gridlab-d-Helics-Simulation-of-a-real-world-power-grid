To represent the average voltage in rectangular complex form, you can convert the phasor form of the average voltage to rectangular complex form using the following formula:

V_avg_rect = V_avg * e^(j*θ)

where V_avg is the magnitude of the average voltage in phasor form, θ is the phase angle in radians (which is 0 degrees for a balanced three-phase system), and e^(j*θ) is the exponential form of the phasor.

In our case, the magnitude of the average voltage is |V_avg| = (1/3)*|V_common|*sqrt(3), and the phase angle is 0 degrees. Therefore, we can write:

V_avg_rect = (1/3)*|V_common|sqrt(3) * e^(j0)

The exponential form of the phasor is:

e^(j0) = cos(0) + jsin(0) = 1 + 0j

Substituting this into the equation for V_avg_rect, we get:

V_avg_rect = (1/3)*|V_common|*sqrt(3) * (1 + 0j)

Simplifying the expression, we get:

V_avg_rect = (1/3)*|V_common|*sqrt(3) + 0j
