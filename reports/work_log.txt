1. Try to assign distribution power and see how outputs change - done
2. First see if we can calculae the input and send it at the same time - Done
    If it takes too much processing power: Try to manage the input differently in a different csv file
    Try to organize the code to fit multiple buildings - done
4. Try to push to github - done 

4/18/23
After talking to Sadab:
1. Try to input current  into the gridlabd model for substation - done
2. Try to input the power into gridlabd model for loads - done

4/21/23
Try to collect the output and store it for each building - done
get the time interval for 5 minutes for NSU01, NBN01, NBM01, NBM02 - done

4/22/23
install gld and helics in windows - running into issues getting support
download those files in windows and stop using virtualbox 
add more outputs from r1 building 
keep generating the output from virtualbox
look into justins model
work on the EF loop
push the files to github

4/23/23
keep generating the output from virtualbox - done 
changing the interval to 5 minues to help process faster - done
Trying to install helics/gridlabd in workstation - gridlabd is not yet supported 
Data visualization and correlation analysis - done
try to apply correlation on the data generated from r1 building - done

4/28/23
So looks like the meter object must be the parent for the load to be able to correctly genertae the data
But the current although it isnt zero, it is still low - why?
Working with IT help to resolve the windows gridlabd error
Read a review paper 
So the simulation is now running in the large data as well 

4/30/23
create the heatmap
Read papers

5/1/23
Work on the EF loop - done
Work on justin's model - done
Do plant operations building too - done
Ask justin to create the diagram (figure) for the entire model - done

5/4/23
Now we dont have to generate the inputs time and again as we can use the ones generated the first time - stupid me!


5/8/23
In the full GLM file, identify substations and which feeders are those - done 
Identify feeder breakers - done
Give the nomenclature for buildings - done
generate 5M file for all those meters - done

Process new output ignoring all unavailable and constant data and - done
split the timestamp to hour, day, month, day of the week etc - done
Generate the heatmap for this new dataset - done
Fit a random forest/Gradient boosting -- Need to identify targets
Access feature importance score attributed to each feature -- After 
(based on these things decide which features to use and which not to)

5/9/23
Train LSTM model to predict the outputs - done

5/10/23
Analyze all the 5M data and see which should be used and which should not - done
Generate the input files for all the necessary buildings - done
Change the publications and subscriptions for main_complete - done
Run the simulation on the main_complete - done

5/11/23
Try find out which parameters to input and which parameters to output and 
generate the predicted outputs for those parameters - first detaild analysis of the model should be done
Right now, the simulation runs and that is enough. 
Push the simulation model to github - done !Thats it for running the simulation - Done

Try to learn if you can generate the data further - just for Dr. Javaid's curiosity 
Study on backtracking a cyber attack through substation analysis - Done

5/12/23
Identify if the simulation is working how it is supposed to: How do I check that? 
    Create a data visualization to check current outputs at each node
    Try to add current values to load and also the impedance and see how the outputs change
    Toggle the impedance in the line and transformer and see how outputs change 

5/17/23
Analyse output 17 - The output from the substation from simulation where all the buildings are added. 
(Make sure it has a pattern)
Try process data for the input parameters for each building separately. Try to run the lstm model to it.
